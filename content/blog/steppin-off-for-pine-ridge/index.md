Stepping off for Pine Ridge. Every step is peace. Following my breath and feeling the earth beneath my feet, supporting every step is a healing step in the right direction. My mental and physical problems are forgotten every time I remember to follow my breath and feel the support of the earth beneath me. This 1,000 mile walk (5,280,000 feet) is giving me the opportunity to practice remembering to return to my breath with approximately 3.6 million steps (one way).

I welcome you all to walk with me, in person or in spirit, as you remember to follow your breathing with every step throughout your daily routine. In the spirit of giving to those who need it most, I'm pleaing for sponsors and donations of $1 for each peaceful step I take in this 3.6 million step journey for Pine Ridge.  Please click the donate button and share this link to help us achieve our desperate goal of $3.6 million to eradicate homelessness and overpopulated households at Pine Ridge. Thank you for your understanding, kindness, and generosity.
